### Public talks over the years

In this section I will try to list various Dev/IT talks I have done at conferences, meetup groups and a few noteworthy company internal over the years. As I am starting this list in Oct. 2022, it will probably take some time to reconstruct all of it, but here  goes the initial brainstorm:

* July 2013: [Project Coin features in Java 7](https://www.slideshare.net/jankrag/java7-coin) - Probably only internal at my workplace
* July 2013: [Introduction to the Option Monad in Scala](https://www.slideshare.net/jankrag/introduction-to-option-monad-in-scala) - Copenhagen Scala Meetup Group

* Oct. 2013: [Git internals - Hogwarts School of ma'Git](https://www.slideshare.net/jankrag/git-internals-26784067) - Originally an internal company talk but reused elsewhere
