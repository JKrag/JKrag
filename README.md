### Public talks over the years

In this section I will try to list various Dev/IT talks I have done at conferences, meetup groups and a few noteworthy company internal over the years. As I am starting this list in Oct. 2022, it will probably take some time to reconstruct all of it, but here  goes the initial brainstorm:

* July 2013: [Project Coin features in Java 7](https://www.slideshare.net/jankrag/java7-coin) - Probably only internal at my workplace
* July 2013: [Introduction to the Option Monad in Scala](https://www.slideshare.net/jankrag/introduction-to-option-monad-in-scala) - Copenhagen Scala Meetup Group
* Sept. 2013: [Intro to Pattern Matching in Scala](https://www.slideshare.net/jankrag/intro-to-pattern-matching-in-scala) - Copenhagen Scala Meetup Group
* Oct. 2013: [Git internals - Hogwarts School of ma'Git](https://www.slideshare.net/jankrag/git-internals-26784067) - Originally an internal company talk but reused elsewhere
* ????: Introducion to Brainf*ck - Copenhagen Tech Polyglots Meetup
* Dec? 2015: Docker workshop - DayOfDocker, Oslo, Norway
* Feb. 2017: [Jedi Mind Tricks in Git](https://www.slideshare.net/jankrag/jedi-mind-tricks-for-git) - Git Merge conference in Brussels
* Docker 101 - DayOfContainers conference Copenhagen
* Dec? 2019: Jedi Mind Tricks in Git - TechBBQ startup conference, Copenhagen
* Nov. 2020 - Webinar about Git (concepts, features and more) for IDA (Danish Engineers Union) - > 350 participants.
* Dec. 2021: 10 Levels of Git Aliases - Copenhagen DevOps Meetup group (and repeated internally in Eficode at least twice)

On top of the above, I have been teaching cat genetics and related topics in various Danish cat clubs since the late 90's.

*I always welcome any speaking gig opportunities*, whether at conferences or meetups, especially on Git related topics. I am happy to redo earlier presentations, I have a few ready-baked ideas (talk-proposals) but also like being pushed to talk about new corners of the topics I know about.

### Git training

A noticable part of my job since 2015 has been providing professional Git training (and the odd trainings on Jenkins & CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes and Azure DevOps) to customers.
In the future, I might add a "road show" list here, on a sub-page, but for now just a few stats as of November 2022:

* Over 130 days worth of Git training
* These include at least 50 runs just of "my" 2 day [Mastering Git](https://www.eficode.com/academy/mastering-git) training.
* Delivered on site in at least 6 Countries on 2 continents (Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Germany & India) 
* Delivered in 3 languages. (Typically English, occasionally Danish & and in a few rare cases in German ðŸ˜±)

If your company is looking for Git training, or you just want to hear why I believe it is worthwhile spending 2 full days (or even more) of your precious time learning and thoroughly understanding Git, then by all means [reach out](mailto:jan.krag@eficode.com).
